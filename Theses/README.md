# Traumschreiber
The Traumschreiber system is the subject of several theses covering different research areas within Cognitive Science and Neuroinformatics. Here, the theses are collected. The following gives a brief summary of the individual projects.

#### _The Traumschreiber System - Enabling Crowd-based, Automated, Complex, Polysomnographic Sleep and Dream Experiments_ - K. Appel, Dissertation

In this dissertation the development of the Traumschreiber System as well as its evaluation is presented. The high-tech sleep mask was developed to enable naive crowd
subjects to perform complex polysomnographic sleep and dream experiments at home. It is shown that on the one hand the quality of polysomnographic data recording – including measurements of EEG, EOG, EMG and ECG–, can compete with commercial medical sleep laboratory systems. On the other hand, it was shown with two field studies that even novice subjects can conduct sleep experiment at their homes with the Traumschreiber.


## App Development

#### _Design and implementation of an Android app to  record, store and manage EEG signals_ - R. A. Rojas Campos, Master's Thesis (August 2019)

This thesis describes the most advanced Traumschreiber app to date. With the Android app, the user can collect, plot, save, manage, and share EEG sessions, recorded with the Traumschreiber system. It furthermore introduces a chatbot expert, used to inform the user about epilepsy and presents general information about epilepsy in a clear and accessible way. The code is available [in this repository](https://github.com/adrocampos/EEG-Droid).


#### _Developing and designing a mediator smartphone application for portable sleep EEG recording and biofeedback with focus on the end user experience_ - M. Jäkel, Bachelor's Thesis (February 2017)

This thesis reports on the implementation of a prototype Android application that introduces users to the sleep mask. With the app, users can, among other, connect the Traumschreiber via Bluetooth to their phones, enabling them to visualize recorded EEG data.


## Detection of Event Related Potentials with the Traumschreiber


#### _Studying Neural Correlates of Mind Wandering with Mobile EEG_ - M. Bammel, Bachelor's Thesis (April 2020)

This thesis constitutes a replication of a study by Braboszez and Delorme (2011) who identified neural markers of low alertness during mind wandering with the Traumschreiber. The experiments expose a significantly decreased alpha and beta frequency band power during mind wandering. However, the replication demonstrates that studying higher cognitive functions in a mobile setup using the Traumschreiber does not yield equivalent results compared to a stationary research graded EEG system. The full sourcecode of the project is available [in the author's repository](https://github.com/mbammel/BscThesis).


#### _Auditory Evoked Potentials with Mobile EEG_ - M. Vidal De Palol, Master's Thesis (March 2019)

This project combines the development of an Android App for real-time EEG visualization and recording and an experiment to assess the capability of the device for recording Auditory Evoked Potentials.

#### _Measuring vMMN, P300 and AEPs with a mobile EEG system_ - M. Reimann, Bachelor's Thesis (September 2018)

Within this thesis the potential of the Traumschreiber as mobile EEG system is explored by evaluating its usability and ability to detect event-related potentials (ERP). It is shown that the device is able to produce good and very good results for the ERP under consideration.


#### _Analyzing event-related potentials in 8-channel EEG data using machine learning methods_ - A.-K. Schalkamp, Bachelor's Thesis (September 2018)

This thesis describes a study performed to evaluate whether EEG data acquired with the Traumschreiber can be used with traditional and single-trial analysis. Furthermore, it expands on the importance of electrode placement.

## Eye Position and Gaze Estimation

#### _Eye gaze estimation and gesture recognition using mobile EEG, An application for sleep communication_ - V. Amo Olea, Master's Thesis (September 2019)

Within this project a real-time eye-gaze estimation and gesture recognition
system using Electrooculography (EOG) was developed. A Convolutional Neural Net was trained to recognize eye-typing gestures and three command gestures from movement with closed eyes.

#### _Extracting Eye Positions from Electrooculographic Recordings Using a Machine Learning Approach_ - F. Laubisch, Bachelor's Thesis (September 2016)

In this thesis the relationship between EOG data provided by the Traumschreiber and eye position obtained with a wearable eye tracking device is assessed. It is shown that the sole EOG data is not yet sufficient to produce reliable eye tracking information.

## Sleep and Lucid Dreaming Research

#### _Conducting a Polysomnographic, Automated Auditory Stimulation Sleep Experiment Using a Portable High-Tech Sleep Mask_ - L.S. Mandt, Bachelor's Thesis (April 2017)
The field study discussed in this thesis evaluates the portable high-tech sleep mask for home-based sleep experiments using polysomnography. Additionally, it examines whether the arousal threshold of individual participants can be determined by exposing them to auditory stimulation during the night.


#### _The Scienticity of Lucid Dream Research - A Theoretical and Empirical Approach_ - K. Lüth, Bachelor's Thesis (July 2015)

This work discusses the science-theoretical and historical background of lucid dream research. It presents a survey concerned with the attitude the public has towards the field. The survey showed that the public has a positive opinion.
